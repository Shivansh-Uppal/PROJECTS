# PROJECTS

The projects created include:

1. Speech recogniton: This Jarvis is executed by the user using speech recognition and prompts the user to perform the specific task, such as emailing, searching on Wikipedia, or StackOverflow.

2. Fire Detection Alarm Status: CNN is used to implement the model (deep learning technique). The model also observe certain computer vision components, which was handled using OpenCV. The model is also given the voice recognition approach, which allow it to generate sound notifications for the users. (Accuracy achieved: 93.18%)

3. Employee leaving aspects: This model uses different EDA techniques and sklearn libraries to get best model prediction. The impoertance of model is to check whether the employee stay in company or not based on conditions to what he/she has been provided with.

4. IPL match analysis: This project deals with learning of EDA tools by focussing on 2 libraries (pandas and matplotlib)
